sidebarTitle: "API Authentication"
description: "This guide explains how to authenticate with the UTMStack API using curl, retrieve a Bearer token, and access secured endpoints. It also includes details about where to find the official API documentation for each instance."
---

###  Step 1: Authentication Request

<Tip>
    Use the **/api/authenticate** endpoint to log in and receive a Bearer token.
</Tip>

> ðŸ”§ Request Example:

````
curl -X POST https://demo.utmstack.com/api/authenticate \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{"username":"demo","password":"your_password"}'
````

<Note>
    Make sure to replace the credentials **(username and password)** with the actual user **credentials for your environment**.    
</Note>


### Step 2: Parse the Response

> The response will be a JSON object containing the Bearer token, usually under the key id_token or similar, for example:

````
{
  "authenticated":true,
  "id_token": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6..."
}
````

### Step 3: Use the Bearer Token

> Include the token in the Authorization header when making requests to protected endpoints.

<Tip>
    Use the **/management/logs** endpoint to log in and receive a Bearer token.
</Tip>

> Request

````
curl -X 'GET' \
  'https://demo.utmstack.com/management/logs' \
  -H 'accept: */*' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzUxMiJ9.eyJzdWIiOiJkZW1vIiwiYXV0aCI6IlJPTEVfQURNSU4sU...'
````

> Response

`````
[
  {
    "name": "ROOT",
    "level": "ERROR"
  },
  {
    "name": "LiquibaseSchemaResolver",
    "level": "INFO"
  },
  {
    "name": "_org",
    "level": "ERROR"
  },
  {
    "name": "_org.springframework",
    "level": "ERROR"
  },
  {
    "name": "_org.springframework.web",
    "level": "ERROR"
  },
]
`````

<Warning>
    What happens when you don't include the Authorization header when making requests to protected endpoints.
</Warning>

<Note>
    Use the **/management/logs** endpoint to log in and receive a Bearer token.
</Note>

> Request

````
curl -X 'GET' \
  'https://demo.utmstack.com/management/logs' \
  -H 'accept: */*'
````

> Response

````
{
  "timestamp": "2025-04-16T16:26:35.664+00:00",
  "status": 401,
  "error": "Unauthorized",
  "path": "/management/logs"
}
````

## Official API Documentation

UTMStack provides two official resources where developers can explore and interact with the API:

### [API Reference on Documentation Portal](https://documentation.utmstack.com/v10/api-reference/logs-resource/get-managementlogs)

You can access the full [API reference](https://documentation.utmstack.com/v10/api-reference/logs-resource/get-managementlogs), including endpoint structure, request/response schemas, and example usage under the **API Reference** tab

### Interactive Swagger UI (Demo Instance)

For hands-on testing and live API interaction, you can explore the Swagger UI provided by the public UTMStack demo instance:

[https://demo.utmstack.com/swagger-ui/index.html](https://demo.utmstack.com/swagger-ui/index.html)

<Note>
    Each client instance has its own unique Swagger URL, based on how their environment is configured.
</Note>

Examples:
- `https://<your-company>.utmstack.com/swagger-ui/index.html`
- `https://utmstack.<your-domain>.com/swagger-ui/index.html`
