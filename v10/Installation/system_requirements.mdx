## 1. Data Storage Overview

Before diving in, be aware that UTMStack approaches data retention in two distinct methods:

* **Hot Log Storage**: Refers to data which isn't archived and can be accessed anytime for immediate analysis.
* **Cold Storage**: Represents archived data that necessitates restoration prior to access.
* **Data Source**: Denotes any individual origin of logs, such as devices, agents, or SaaS integrations.

> Assumption: 50 data sources (devices) generate approximately 100 GB of data per month.

## 2. UTMStack Server Specifications

The UTMStack server is responsible for managing and orchestrating platform operations. Below are the recommended hardware specifications for hot log storage:

| Data Sources (Approx. Monthly Data) | Cores | RAM   | Disk Space |
| ----------------------------------- | ------| ------| -----------|
| **50 (100 GB)**                     | 8     | 16 GB | 150 GB    |
| **120 (250 GB)**                    | 16    | 32 GB | 250 GB    |
| **240 (500 GB)**                    | 32    | 64 GB | 450 GB    |

> **Scalability:** These tiers can be adjusted based on the number of devices and desired log retention period.

## 3. Architecture Requirements

To run UTMStack optimally, your hardware must meet the following minimum specifications:

**CPU Requirements**

* **Processor:** Must support x86-64 v2 architecture.
* **Processor:** Must support x86-64 v2 architecture.

**CPU Requirements for Virtualized Environments**

UTMStack supports the following **CPU architectures** in **QEMU/KVM** environments:
	1.	**x86-64-v2 (QEMU):** Optimized 64-bit architecture with second-gen instruction set.
	2.	**x86-64-v2-AES (QEMU):** Adds AES-NI encryption acceleration for improved security.
	3.	**x86-64-v4 (QEMU):** Advanced fourth-generation architecture with enhanced performance.
	4.	**Host (KVM):** Uses the host processorâ€™s features directly for maximum performance.

## 4. Integration and Logging Volume Considerations

**Integration Requirements**

* Each integration requires **at least 1GB of reserved space** to maintain **efficient system operation**.

**Log Volume Considerations**
*	If logs exceed **1GB within a 10-minute interval, immediate** contact with the support team is required to **maintain stability and performance**.

## 5. Supported Operating Systems

UTMStack is officially supported on Ubuntu 22.04 LTS.

> For installation instructions, refer to the [UTMStack Installation Guide](../Installation/setup_guide)

##  6. Federated Server (UTMStackFSInstaller)

For UTMStack federated installations, the following minimum system requirements apply:

**Recommended Operating System**
*	Ubuntu 22.04 LTS

**Resources for Master:**

| Recommendation                | Cores | RAM   | Disk Space |
| ----------------------------- | ----- | ----- | ---------- |
| Minimum Required (non-prod)   | 2     | 4 GB  | 20 GB      |
| Recommended (prod)            | 4     | 8 GB  | 20 GB      |
