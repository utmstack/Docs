### Step 4: Configuration of UTMStackFS
After successfully installing UTMStackFS on your servers, it is important to configure the necessary services to ensure proper functionality. This step involves setting up best-practice firewall rulesets to control network traffic effectively. Additionally, you have the option to integrate third-party applications like M365 to enhance UTMStack's capabilities.

This section provides an overview of the required firewall rules for different components of UTMStackFS. Please refer to the following guidelines:

**Required Ports:**

- **Port: 22/TCP**
  - Purpose: Secure Shell (We recommend creating a firewall rule to allow it only from the admin workstation).

- **Port: 80/TCP**
  - Purpose: UTMStack Web-based Graphical User Interface Redirector (We recommend creating a firewall rule to allow it only from admin and security analyst workstations).

- **Port: 443/TCP**
  - Purpose: UTMStack Web-based Graphical User Interface (We recommend creating a firewall rule to allow it only from admin and security analyst workstations).

### Step 5:  Installing and Configuring an SSL/TLS certificate
