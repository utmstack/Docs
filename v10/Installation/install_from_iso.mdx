### Step 5: Server Initialization and Automatic Configuration

2. You can monitor the configuration process by using the following commands:
   ```bash
   $ sudo su
   ```
   [enter password for utmstack]
   ```
   # tail -f /home/utmstack/installer.log
   ```

```
   # cat /root/utmstack/utmstack.yml
```

2. After confirming that the installation has completed successfully, open a web browser on your computer or virtual machine.

3. Enter the IP address obtained from the previous steps into the browser. 

4. When you see a warning about the connection not being private, click on **Advanced** and then **Proceed** to accept the certificate.
