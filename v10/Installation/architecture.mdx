## Deployment Models
UTMStack presents four compelling deployment models, each catering to specific requirements and offering distinct advantages:

### 1. Master Only Deployment: Unparalleled Data Control and Security


A **Master Only Deployment** of UTMStack is dedicated to an individual customer, ensuring unparalleled data control and security.

By opting for a master-only installation, organizations can maintain complete control over their data. UTMStack can be effortlessly deployed within the customer's network, whether on a virtual machine or a physical server. This approach allows for direct log gathering from customer devices and applications, ensuring data remains within the organization's boundaries.

With data isolation and enhanced security, the master-only deployment model offers peace of mind, particularly for organizations concerned about sharing sensitive information with third parties.

### 2. Federated Master Deployment: Streamlined Management for MSPs
