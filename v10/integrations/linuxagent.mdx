## Installing Linux agent

<Note>
    The Linux agent captures system and application logs and sends them to a UTMStack master server or probe/proxy, monitors system activity, and executes incident response commands. The UTMStack agents communicate over ports 9000 and 50051. Please make sure these ports are open.
</Note>
