## Installing Azure

### 1. Create "Event Hub" 
<Note>
    Using the official Azure documentation [Quickstart: Create an event hub using Azure portal](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/event-hubs/event-hubs-create)
</Note>

### 2. Create a new "Shared access policy" to allow access to the Event Hub created, make sure you select the "Listen" permission.

### 3. Get the Event Hub Shared Access policies - Connection string–primary key from "Shared access policy" created previously. It will be used to configure your tenant.

### 4. Get the Consumer Group Name
> In: All services-> Event Hubs -> Your_Event_Hub_Namespace -> Event Hubs -> Your_Event_Hub_Instance -> Consumer groups. It will be used to configure your tenant.

  alt="Azure"
/>

<Note>
    Create a new consumer group specifically for Logstash. Do not use the $default or any other consumer group that might already be in use. Reusing consumer groups among non-related consumers can cause unexpected behavior and possibly lost events. All Logstash instances should use the same consumer group so that they can work together for processing events.
</Note>

### 5. Create a "Storage Account"

<Note>
    Using the official Azure documentation [Quickstart: Create a storage account](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-account-create?tabs=azure-portal)
</Note>

### 6. Get the "Storage Container Name" 
> In: All services -> Storage accounts -> Your_Storage_Account -> Containers. It will be used to configure your tenant.
