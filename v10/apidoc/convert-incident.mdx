## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Incident Naming">
    **Use descriptive names:**
    - Include attack type: "Brute Force Attack Investigation"
    - Reference affected systems: "Web Server Compromise - Server01"
    - Add timeline context: "Ransomware Incident - Oct 2024"
    - Be specific but concise
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Incident ID Management">
    **ID assignment strategy:**
    - Use sequential numbering for easy tracking
    - Consider year/month prefixes: 202410001
    - Reserve ID ranges for different incident types
    - Ensure uniqueness across the organization
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Source Documentation">
    **Provide clear sources:**
    - "SOC Team Escalation" for manual escalations
    - "Automated Correlation Engine" for system-detected patterns
    - "Customer Report" for externally reported issues
    - Include analyst name for accountability
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Integration with Incident Management

<Info>
**Platform Integration:**
- Converted incidents appear in the UTMStack incident management interface
- Original alerts remain linked to the incident for reference
- Incident timeline includes all alert details and timestamps
- Case management workflow is automatically initiated
- Notifications sent to configured incident response team members
</Info>

---

## Security Considerations

<Warning>
**Security Notes:**
- Requires Bearer token authentication
- Incident creation is audited for compliance
- Only authorized users can convert alerts to incidents
- Incident IDs must be unique to prevent conflicts
- Alert IDs must exist and be accessible to the user
</Warning>
