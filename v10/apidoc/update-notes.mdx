## Common Use Cases

### Investigation Notes

```javascript
// Document investigation findings
await updateAlertNotes("alert-123", 
  "Investigation Summary:\n" +
  "- Analyzed source IP: 192.168.1.100\n" +
  "- Reviewed firewall logs for the past 24 hours\n" +  
  "- Contacted user for verification\n" +
  "- Determined as legitimate access from approved device\n" +
  "- No further action required"
);
```

### False Positive Documentation

```python
# Document false positive reasoning
update_alert_notes("alert-456", 
    "FALSE POSITIVE: Alert triggered by scheduled backup process. "
    "Backup runs daily at 2 AM. Added exception rule to prevent future alerts."
)
```

### Escalation Notes

```javascript
// Document escalation
const escalationNote = 
  "ESCALATED TO SECURITY TEAM:\n" +
  "- High severity alert confirmed as potential breach\n" +
  "- Initial response completed at " + new Date().toISOString() + "\n" +
  "- Assigned to: security-team@company.com\n" +
  "- Next steps: Full forensic investigation required";

await updateAlertNotes("alert-789", escalationNote);
```

### Clear Notes

```python
# Clear existing notes
update_alert_notes("alert-101", "")
```

---

## Best Practices

  ### Note Content Guidelines
    **Structured Documentation:**
    - Include timestamp and analyst name
    - Describe investigation steps taken
    - Document evidence found or lack thereof
    - Specify next actions or resolution
    - Use clear, professional language
  

  ### False Positive Handling
    **Best Practices:**
    - Clearly mark as "FALSE POSITIVE" 
    - Explain the root cause
    - Document prevention measures taken
    - Reference any rules or exceptions added
    - Include confidence level in assessment
  

  ### Investigation Workflow
    **Recommended Flow:**
    1. Initial triage notes with priority assessment
    2. Investigation progress updates
    3. Evidence collection documentation
    4. Final resolution and lessons learned
    5. Handoff notes if escalating to other teams

## Advanced Examples

### Structured Investigation Notes

```javascript
const createInvestigationNote = (alertId, findings) => {
  const timestamp = new Date().toISOString();
  const analyst = "john.doe@company.com";
  
  const structuredNote = 
    "=== INVESTIGATION REPORT ===\n" +
    `Timestamp: ${timestamp}\n` +
    `Analyst: ${analyst}\n` +
    `Alert ID: ${alertId}\n\n` +
    "INITIAL ASSESSMENT:\n" +
    `${findings.assessment}\n\n` +
    "INVESTIGATION STEPS:\n" +
    findings.steps.map((step, index) => `${index + 1}. ${step}`).join('\n') + "\n\n" +
    "EVIDENCE:\n" +
    `${findings.evidence}\n\n` +
    "CONCLUSION:\n" +
    `${findings.conclusion}\n\n` +
    "NEXT ACTIONS:\n" +
    `${findings.nextActions}\n` +
    "=== END REPORT ===";
  
  return updateAlertNotes(alertId, structuredNote);
};

// Usage
await createInvestigationNote("alert-123", {
  assessment: "Medium severity - suspicious login from new location",
  steps: [
    "Verified user identity through secondary channels",
    "Checked login history for similar patterns", 
    "Analyzed geolocation data",
    "Contacted user directly via phone"
  ],
  evidence: "User confirmed legitimate travel to new location. Phone verification successful.",
  conclusion: "Legitimate user activity - false positive",
  nextActions: "Add travel notification to user profile. No further investigation needed."
});
```

## Security Considerations

> **‚ö†Ô∏è Warning:** **Security Notes:**
- All note changes are audited for compliance
- Notes are stored in plain text - avoid sensitive data
- Users need proper permissions to update alert notes
- Alert ID must be a valid UUID that exists in the system
