## Creating a New Dashboard
Upon clicking the New Dashboard option, a pop-up window appears on the right side of your screen. This window displays a list of pre-created visualizations, tailored based on the most common and useful visualizations requested by our users.

You can now select your preferred visualization for the dashboard you wish to create by checking the respective checkboxes. For example, we are going to create a dashboard for manage the logon failure, using the **Top 5 User Logon Failures**, **Top 5 Failure Reason Local Logon Failure**s, and **Detail User Logon Failure** visualizations.

<Tip>  
  Now we click in the **+ Add visualizations** buttons in the botton of the windows.
