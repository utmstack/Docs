# SSL Certificate Management in UTMStack


### Manual SSL Certificate Installation

Before beginning, ensure you've downloaded your certificate files. After downloading:

1. You should have:
   - A certificate file with the extension `.crt` or `.pem`
   - A private key with the extension `.key` or `.pem`
   
2. Rename the files:
   - Certificate: `utm.crt`
   - Private Key: `utm.key`
   
3. Transfer both files to your server:

```bash
   mv utm.crt /UTMStack/cert/
   mv utm.key /UTMStack/cert/
```

4. Restart Docker for the changes to take effect:

```bash
systemctl restart docker
```

5. Allow approximately 10 minutes for the stack to restart.

<Note>
    Once these steps are completed, your SSL certificate will be installed and configured for UTMStack. For any issues or questions during the installation, please contact our support team.
