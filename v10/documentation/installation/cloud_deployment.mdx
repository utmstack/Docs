# Cloud Deployment Guide for UTMStack v10.9.0

Welcome to the UTMStack Cloud Deployment Guide. This document provides comprehensive instructions for deploying UTMStack on major cloud platforms such as AWS, Azure, and GCP. UTMStack is an open-source security platform designed for Ubuntu 22.04 LTS, offering encrypted communications, containerized microservices, and strong authentication mechanisms.

## System Requirements

Before deploying UTMStack, ensure that your system meets the necessary hardware and software prerequisites. Detailed system requirements can be found in the [System Requirements Documentation](https://documentation.utmstack.com/v10/Installation/system_requirements).

### Recommended System Resources

- **Operating System**: Ubuntu 22.04 LTS
- **Resource Allocation**:
  - For 50 data sources (120 GB of hot log storage): 4 Cores, 16 GB RAM, 150 GB Disk Space
  - For 120 data sources (250 GB of hot log storage): 8 Cores, 16 GB RAM, 250 GB Disk Space
  - For 240 data sources (500 GB of hot log storage): 16 Cores, 32 GB RAM, 500 GB Disk Space
  - For 500 data sources (1000 GB of hot log storage): 32 Cores, 64 GB RAM, 1000 GB Disk Space
- **Scaling**: For more than 500 data sources, consider adding secondary nodes for horizontal scaling.

## Installation Steps

UTMStack can be installed using an installer file or an ISO image. Below are the steps for installation using the installer file.

### Preparing for Installation

1. Update packages list:
   ```bash
sudo apt update
   ```
2. Install WGET:
   ```bash
sudo apt install wget
   ```
3. Download the latest version of the installer:
   ```bash
wget http://github.com/utmstack/UTMStack/releases/latest/download/installer
   ```
4. Change to root user:
   ```bash
sudo su
   ```
5. Set execution permissions:
   ```bash
chmod +x installer
   ```

### Running the Installation
