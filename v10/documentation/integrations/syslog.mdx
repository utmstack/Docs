# Integration guide for SysLog


## Installing SysLog

<Warning>
    This integration requires a UTMStack agent to work properly. Please, make sure you have installed it before you continue.
</Warning>

> This integration relies on Syslog. Logs received via Syslog are parsed and correlated by UTMStack automatically.


### 1. Configure your device to send logs to a UTMStack agent on ports:
        * 7014 TCP
        * 7014 UDP


### 2. Enable log collector.

<Note>
    To enable the log collector where you have the UTMStack agent installed, follow the instructions below based on your operating system and preferred protocol.

<Tip>
    Execute command according to the selected platform
</Tip>

<Warning>
    Agent installation commands for operating systems **must be copied directly from your UTMStack instance**, under the **Integrations** section.  
    This ensures that all tokens, identifiers, and configuration parameters are accurate and specific to your environment.
</Warning>
