# How to Install cURL in Windows


## Check if You Already Have cURL

You might not need to install anything:

- If you are using **Windows Server 2019** or **Windows 10 version 1803 or later**, `curl` is likely already installed.
- Default path: `C:\Windows\System32\curl.exe`


### 2. Choose a Permanent Folder 

Recommended folders:

- `C:\curl`
- `C:\Program Files\curl`
- `C:\Program Files\tools`

<Note>
Do **not** move the folder once placed.
</Note>


## Test the Installation

Open a Command Prompt and run:

```bash
curl -V
