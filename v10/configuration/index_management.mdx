## Managing Indices


> To **delete an index**, click on the delete action (‚ùå) next to the index you wish to remove. Be cautious as this action is irreversible.

## Searching Within an Index

Use the search bar at the top of the index table to filter and search for specific indices.

<Note>
The indices are automatically named based on the date and type of logs they contain.
</Note>

<Note>
The status `open` indicates that the index is active and can be written to or searched.
</Note>
    
<Tip>
**Tip:** Regularly monitor the size and document count of your indices to ensure optimal performance and storage management.
