# Deployment Best Practices for UTMStack

Welcome to the UTMStack Deployment Best Practices guide. This document provides recommended practices for deploying UTMStack, an open-source security platform optimized for Ubuntu 22.04 LTS. UTMStack leverages encrypted communications, containerized microservices, and strong authentication to deliver a secure and scalable solution for managing log data.

## System Requirements

To ensure optimal performance and installation of UTMStack, adhere to the following system specifications:

### Hardware Specifications

- **Processor:** Must support x86-64 v2 architecture.
- **RAM:** Minimum of 16 GB.
- **Disk Space:** Minimum of 100 GB for federated servers.
- **Cores:** At least 4 CPU cores.

### Storage Methods

UTMStack uses two distinct data retention methods:

- **Hot Log Storage:** Data that is not archived and can be accessed anytime for immediate analysis.
- **Cold Storage:** Archived data that requires restoration before access.

### Resource Recommendations

For one month of hot log storage:

- **50 Data Sources (100 GB):** 8 Cores, 16 GB RAM, 150 GB Disk Space
- **120 Data Sources (250 GB):** 16 Cores, 32 GB RAM, 250 GB Disk Space
- **240 Data Sources (500 GB):** 32 Cores, 64 GB RAM, 450 GB Disk Space

&gt; **Scalability:** Adjust these tiers based on the number of devices and desired log retention period. For deployments exceeding 500 data sources, consider adding secondary nodes for horizontal scaling.

## Installation Steps

### Preparing for Installation

1. Update packages list:
   ```bash
sudo apt update
   ```
2. Install WGET:
   ```bash
sudo apt install wget
   ```
3. Download the latest version of the installer:
   ```bash
wget http://github.com/utmstack/UTMStack/releases/latest/download/installer
   ```
4. Change to root user:
   ```bash
sudo su
   ```
5. Set execution permissions:
   ```bash
chmod +x installer
   ```

### Running the Installation

Execute the installer without parameters:
```bash
./installer
```

Once installed, use `admin` as the user and the password generated during installation to log in. The password and other configurations can be found in `/root/utmstack.yml`.

### Required Ports

- **22/TCP:** Secure Shell (SSH) - Allow only from admin workstation.
- **80/TCP:** UTMStack Web-based GUI Redirector - Allow only from admin and security analyst workstations.
- **443/TCP:** UTMStack Web-based GUI - Allow only from admin and security analyst workstations.
- **9090/TCP:** Cockpit Web-based GUI for Servers - Allow only from admin workstation.

&gt; Additional ports may be required for UTMStack's integrations to receive logs. Follow the security recommendations in the integration guide if available.

## Security Considerations

- **Encrypted Communications:** All data in transit between agents and UTMStack servers is encrypted using TLS.
- **Authentication:** Connections to the UTMStack server require a unique key of over 24 characters.
- **Credential Protection:** User credentials are encrypted in the database and protected by fail2ban mechanisms and two-factor authentication (2FA).

## Summary

Deploying UTMStack involves careful planning of system resources and adherence to security best practices. By following the recommended hardware specifications and installation steps, you can ensure a secure and efficient deployment of UTMStack on Ubuntu 22.04 LTS.
