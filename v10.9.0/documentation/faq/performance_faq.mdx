# Performance FAQ

Welcome to the Performance FAQ for UTMStack version 10.9.0. This page addresses common questions related to performance and optimization, providing insights into system requirements, data management, and integration considerations to ensure optimal performance of UTMStack.

## System Requirements

To ensure optimal installation and performance of UTMStack, it is crucial to adhere to the recommended system specifications. These requirements are designed to support efficient data processing and storage.

### Data Storage Overview

UTMStack employs two distinct methods for data retention:

- **Hot Log Storage**: Data that is readily accessible for immediate analysis.
- **Cold Storage**: Archived data that requires restoration before access.

For example, 50 data sources (devices) can generate approximately 100 GB of data per month.

### UTMStack Server Specifications

The following table outlines the recommended hardware specifications for hot log storage based on the number of data sources:

| Data Sources (Approx. Monthly Data) | Cores | RAM | Disk Space |
| ------------------------------------- | ------- | ------ | ------------ |
| 50 (100 GB) | 8 | 16 GB | 150 GB |
| 120 (250 GB) | 16 | 32 GB | 250 GB |
| 240 (500 GB) | 32 | 64 GB | 450 GB |

These tiers can be adjusted based on the number of devices and desired log retention period.

### Architecture Requirements

For optimal performance, your hardware must meet the following minimum specifications:

- **Processor**: Must support x86-64 v2 architecture.
- **Operating System**: Ubuntu 22.04 LTS is officially supported.

For virtualized environments, UTMStack supports the following CPU architectures in QEMU/KVM environments:

- **x86-64-v2 (QEMU)**: Optimized 64-bit architecture.
- **x86-64-v2-AES (QEMU)**: Adds AES-NI encryption for improved security.
- **x86-64-v4 (QEMU)**: Advanced architecture with enhanced performance.
- **Host (KVM)**: Uses the host processor’s features directly for maximum performance.

## Integration and Logging Volume Considerations

### Integration Requirements

Each integration requires at least 1GB of reserved space to maintain efficient system operation.

### Log Volume Considerations

If logs exceed 1GB within a 10-minute interval, immediate contact with the support team is required to maintain stability and performance.

## Data Retention Management

UTMStack manages data retention through index rollover, snapshot archiving, and hot/cold storage configurations to optimize log storage and maintain system performance.

### Index Rollover

UTMStack’s Index Rollover feature automatically deletes indices once they meet specific conditions, such as data size or age. This helps in optimizing space and maintaining system performance.

### Snapshot Archiving

- **Hot Storage**: Actively accessed data resides here for real-time access.
- **Cold Storage**: Archived data that requires restoration before access.

## Summary

This document provides an overview of the performance-related aspects of UTMStack, focusing on system requirements, data storage methods, and integration considerations. By adhering to these guidelines, users can ensure that UTMStack operates efficiently and effectively.
