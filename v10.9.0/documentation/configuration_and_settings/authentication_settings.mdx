# Authentication Settings

## Introduction

This guide provides an overview of configuring authentication settings in UTMStack version 10.9.0. It covers the setup and management of LDAP, SAML, and multi-factor authentication within the UTMStack platform. The guide is part of the Configuration and Settings group, focusing on system configuration and administrative settings.

## Configuration Overview

### LDAP Configuration

LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol) is a protocol used to access and maintain distributed directory information services over a network. Configuring LDAP within UTMStack allows for centralized authentication and user management.

### SAML Configuration

SAML (Security Assertion Markup Language) is an open standard for exchanging authentication and authorization data between parties. Setting up SAML in UTMStack enables single sign-on (SSO) capabilities, improving security and user experience by reducing the need for multiple logins.

### Multi-Factor Authentication

Multi-factor authentication (MFA) adds an extra layer of security by requiring users to provide two or more verification factors to gain access. This section would typically guide you through enabling and configuring MFA in UTMStack to enhance security.

## API Endpoints for Authentication

UTMStack provides several API endpoints to manage user authentication and account operations:

- **Check Authentication Status**: Use the `GET` method to verify if a user is authenticated.
- **Authorize Users**: The `POST` method allows for user authorization using JSON Web Tokens (JWT).
- **Manage Accounts**: Endpoints are available for retrieving and saving account details.
- **Password Management**: APIs support initiating and completing password resets, as well as changing passwords.

## Compliance and Security

### Compliance Management

UTMStack's compliance management module aids in generating and managing reports to meet regulatory standards such as HIPAA, GDPR, GLBA, SOC 2, FISMA, CMMC, and PCI-DSS. It provides tailored dashboards and templates for monitoring compliance.

### Security Alerts and Account Activity

The platform allows monitoring of security alerts and account activity, crucial for maintaining compliance and security standards. Users can generate necessary reports for auditors, ensuring adherence to various compliance requirements.

## Summary

This guide outlines the essential components of configuring authentication settings in UTMStack. By integrating LDAP, SAML, and multi-factor authentication, organizations can enhance security and streamline user management. The provided API endpoints facilitate efficient user and account management, while the compliance management module ensures adherence to critical regulatory standards.
