# Notification Settings

## Introduction

This guide provides an overview of configuring alert notifications and escalation rules in UTMStack version 10.9.0. It is part of the broader system configuration and administrative settings documentation. The guide focuses on the management of alerts, including updating alert statuses, converting alerts to incidents, and managing alert tags.

## Alert Management

Alert management is crucial for maintaining system security and operational efficiency. UTMStack provides several API endpoints to manage alerts effectively:

### Updating Alert Status

To update the status of alerts, use the `/api/utm-alerts/status` endpoint. The request body must include:

- `alertIds`: An array of strings identifying the alerts.
- `status`: An integer representing the new status.

### Converting Alerts to Incidents

Alerts can be converted to incidents using the `/api/utm-alerts/convert-to-incident` endpoint. The required fields in the request body are:

- `eventIds`: An array of strings for event identifiers.
- `incidentId`: An integer for the incident identifier.
- `incidentName`: A string for the name of the incident.
- `incidentSource`: A string indicating the source of the incident.

### Managing Alert Tags

Alert tags can be updated via the `/api/utm-alerts/tags` endpoint. The request body should include:

- `alertIds`: An array of strings for alert identifiers.
- `tags`: An array of strings representing the tags to be applied.

## Alert Response Rules

UTMStack supports the creation and management of alert response rules. These rules define actions to be taken when specific conditions are met. The `UtmAlertResponseRuleDTO` schema includes:

- `name`: A string for the rule name.
- `conditions`: An array of conditions that trigger the rule.
- `command`: A string specifying the command to execute.
- `active`: A boolean indicating if the rule is active.
- `agentPlatform`: A string specifying the platform for the agent.

## Summary

This guide covered the configuration of alert notifications and escalation rules in UTMStack. Key functionalities include updating alert statuses, converting alerts to incidents, and managing alert tags. Additionally, the creation and management of alert response rules are supported to automate responses based on predefined conditions.
