# Log Collection and Analysis with UTMStack

## Introduction

UTMStack is an open-source security platform designed for Ubuntu 22.04 LTS. It provides comprehensive security services, including log management, threat detection, compliance management, and advanced reporting. This guide focuses on analyzing UTMStack logs for troubleshooting purposes, leveraging its powerful capabilities for log collection and analysis.

## Log Management and Analysis

### Log Management (SIEM)

UTMStack integrates log management with its Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) capabilities. It allows for real-time log collection and correlation, providing a robust foundation for forensic analysis and compliance reporting. The platform supports flexible, no-code customizable dashboards and reports, enabling users to tailor their monitoring and analysis to specific needs.

### Data Storage Overview

UTMStack uses two primary methods for data retention:

- **Hot Log Storage**: Data that is not archived and can be accessed at any time for immediate analysis.
- **Cold Storage**: Archived data that requires restoration before access.

The system is designed to handle varying volumes of data, with scalable resource recommendations based on the number of data sources and the volume of logs generated.

### System Requirements

To ensure optimal performance, UTMStack requires specific hardware configurations based on the volume of data:

| Data Sources (Approx. Monthly Data) | Cores | RAM | Disk Space |
| ------------------------------------- | ------- | ------ | ------------ |
| 50 (100 GB) | 8 | 16 GB | 150 GB |
| 120 (250 GB) | 16 | 32 GB | 250 GB |
| 240 (500 GB) | 32 | 64 GB | 450 GB |

These configurations ensure that the system can manage and process logs efficiently, supporting both hot and cold storage needs.
