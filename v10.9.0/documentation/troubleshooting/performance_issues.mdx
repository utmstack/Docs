# Performance Issues in UTMStack v10.9.0

## Introduction

This guide aims to help diagnose and resolve performance problems in UTMStack, a unified threat management platform that integrates SIEM and XDR technologies. UTMStack is designed to provide real-time threat detection and response through log correlation and threat intelligence. However, performance issues can arise due to various factors, such as system requirements, data management, and integration configurations. This document provides insights into these aspects to help maintain optimal performance.

## System Requirements

To ensure optimal performance, UTMStack requires adherence to specific system requirements. The following hardware specifications are recommended:

- **Processor**: Must support x86-64 v2 architecture.
- **RAM**: Minimum of 16GB.
- **Disk Space**: At least 100GB for federated servers.
- **Operating System**: Officially supported on Ubuntu 22.04 LTS.

For a detailed overview of system requirements, visit the [UTMStack System Requirements documentation](https://documentation.utmstack.com/v10/Installation/system_requirements).

## Data Management

Efficient data management is crucial for maintaining performance. UTMStack employs several strategies:

### Index Management

- **Deleting Indices**: Regularly delete unnecessary indices to free up resources. This can be done by clicking the delete action next to the index.
- **Monitoring Indices**: Keep track of the size and document count of indices to ensure they do not impact system performance.

For more information on managing indices, refer to the [Index Management documentation](https://documentation.utmstack.com/v10/configuration/index_management).

### Data Retention

UTMStack uses index rollover and snapshot archiving to manage data retention:

- **Index Rollover**: Automatically deletes indices based on data size or age to optimize storage.
- **Snapshot Archiving**: Archives data to cold storage for compliance and performance optimization.

Detailed instructions on configuring data retention can be found in the [Data Retention documentation](https://documentation.utmstack.com/v10/configuration/data_retention).

## Integration and Logging Volume Considerations

Each integration in UTMStack requires at least 1GB of reserved space to maintain efficient operation. If log volumes exceed 1GB within a 10-minute interval, it is crucial to contact the support team to prevent performance degradation.

## Monitoring and Analysis

UTMStack provides customizable dashboards and reports for monitoring and analyzing security data. These tools allow users to:

- Build and modify dashboards without coding.
- Monitor device performance and resource utilization.
- Generate uptime reports and proactive alerts for misconfigurations.

For further details on utilizing dashboards, visit the [UTMStack Dashboard documentation](https://documentation.utmstack.com/v10/dashboards/dashboard).

## Summary

Maintaining optimal performance in UTMStack involves adhering to system requirements, managing data efficiently, and monitoring integrations. By following the guidelines provided in this document, users can diagnose and resolve common performance issues effectively.
