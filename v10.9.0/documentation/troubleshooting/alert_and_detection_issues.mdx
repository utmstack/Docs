# Alert and Detection Issues

## Introduction

This guide provides troubleshooting steps for common issues related to alert and detection in UTMStack. It focuses on debugging detection rules and resolving alert generation problems. UTMStack is a unified threat management platform that integrates SIEM and XDR technologies for real-time threat detection and response.

## Alert Rule Execution

Alert rule execution in UTMStack involves several key components and statuses. Understanding these can help diagnose issues related to alert generation and rule execution.

### Execution Criteria

The execution of alert rules is governed by specific criteria, which include:

- **ID**: Unique identifier for the execution.
- **Rule ID**: Identifier for the specific rule being executed.
- **Alert ID**: Identifier for the alert generated.
- **Agent**: The agent responsible for executing the rule.
- **Execution Date**: The date and time when the rule was executed.
- **Execution Status**: The current status of the rule execution, which can be `EXECUTED`, `PENDING`, or `FAILED`.
- **Non-Execution Cause**: Reasons for non-execution, such as `AGENT_OFFLINE`, `AGENT_NOT_FOUND`, or `UNKNOWN`.

### Rule Execution Object

The `UtmAlertResponseRuleExecution` object defines the properties required for rule execution:

- **ID**: Integer format.
- **Rule ID**: Integer format.
- **Alert ID**: String with a maximum length of 150 characters.
- **Command**: The command executed by the rule.
- **Command Result**: The result of the executed command.
- **Agent**: String with a maximum length of 150 characters.
- **Execution Date**: Date-time format.
- **Execution Status**: Enum values include `EXECUTED`, `PENDING`, `FAILED`.
- **Non-Execution Cause**: Enum values include `AGENT_OFFLINE`, `AGENT_NOT_FOUND`, `UNKNOWN`.
- **Execution Retries**: Integer format.

## Incident and Alert Management

### Incident Status Changes

The `AlertIncidentStatusChangeDTO` object handles changes in incident status:

- **Incident ID**: Integer format.
- **Alert IDs**: Array of strings.
- **Status**: Integer format indicating the status of the incident.

### Alert Tags and Updates

Alerts can be managed and updated through various schemas:

- **UtmAlertTag**: Defines properties such as `tagName`, `tagColor`, and `systemOwner`.
- **UpdateAlertTagsRequestBody**: Allows updating alert tags with properties like `alertIds`, `tags`, and `createRule`.
