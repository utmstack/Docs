## Introduction

UTMStack is an open-source Unified Threat Management platform that offers comprehensive security services, including SIEM, threat detection, incident response, compliance, and advanced reporting. This guide focuses on creating custom detection rules to enhance threat detection and response capabilities within your environment.

## Threat Detection Technology

UTMStack's threat detection engine integrates several rule-based correlation systems, heuristic analysis, and machine learning algorithms. These modules operate independently and sometimes interact to provide a holistic analysis of events.

### Heuristic and Rule-based Analysis Engine

- UTMStack leverages powerful correlation engines with a total of 154,000 detection rules. These rules aggregate, correlate, and analyze log data, network traffic, and system internal activity from on-premises and cloud devices or SaaS.

### Machine Learning Anomaly-based Engine

- The machine learning engine analyzes the environment to define custom rules and baselines, allowing the system to learn from the environment and identify abnormal and threatening behavior.

### Threat Intelligence Database Correlation

- UTMStack analyzes security IP feeds related to online attacks, service abuse, malware, botnets, command and control servers, and other cybercrime activities.

## Customizable Dashboards and Reports

UTMStack provides flexible, no-code customizable dashboards and reports for security monitoring, compliance, forensic analysis, and uptime management. This flexibility allows organizations to tailor their monitoring and reporting to fit unique use cases.

- Dashboards and reports can be created, modified, and deleted without writing code.
- The platform includes a powerful dashboard and report builder for personalized monitoring experiences and advanced compliance auditing.

## Compliance Management

UTMStack streamlines compliance management by providing dedicated sections, built-in reports, and dashboards for major standards like HIPAA, GDPR, and GLBA. This enables users to monitor security alerts, account activity, and generate necessary reports for auditors.

- Compliance with regulations often requires generating reports for internal use and auditors.
- UTMStack simplifies compliance management by combining essential security tools into a single database and providing built-in reports and interactive dashboards.

## Rule Execution and Non-Execution Filters

The API defines data schemas for rule execution status and non-execution cause filters, specifying allowed values and structure.

### Rule Execution Status Filter

- **Allowed Values:** EXECUTED, PENDING, FAILED

### Rule Non-Execution Cause Filter

- **Allowed Values:** AGENT_OFFLINE, AGENT_NOT_FOUND, UNKNOWN

## Summary

UTMStack provides a comprehensive platform for threat detection and response, integrating SIEM and XDR technologies. By leveraging rule-based and machine learning engines, UTMStack offers powerful tools for creating custom detection rules tailored to specific environments. The platform's flexible dashboards and compliance management features further enhance its utility, making it a robust solution for modern cybersecurity challenges.
