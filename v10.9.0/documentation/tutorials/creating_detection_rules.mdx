# Creating Detection Rules in UTMStack

Welcome to the tutorial on building custom threat detection rules using UTMStack. This guide will walk you through the essential features and capabilities of UTMStack's threat detection system, focusing on creating and managing detection rules.

## Introduction to UTMStack

UTMStack is an open-source, enterprise-ready unified threat management platform that combines SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) and XDR (Extended Detection and Response) technologies. It provides comprehensive security through integrated rule-based, heuristic, and machine learning threat detection, user and file activity monitoring, compliance management, threat intelligence correlation, and customizable data visualization and reporting tools. For more details, visit the [UTMStack introduction page](https://documentation.utmstack.com/v10/Getting%20started/introduction).

## Threat Detection Technology

UTMStack's threat detection engine comprises several rule-based correlation systems, scanners, and AI-powered machine learning algorithms. These modules operate independently, and sometimes their functionalities overlap and interact to generate a holistic analysis of events.

### Heuristic and Rule-based Analysis Engine

- UTMStack leverages powerful correlation engines for a total of 154,000 detection rules. These rules aggregate, correlate, and analyze log data, network traffic, and system internal activity generated by on-premises and cloud devices or SaaS.

### Machine Learning Anomaly-based Engine

- The system analyzes the environment and defines custom rules and baselines. This learning mechanism allows the system to identify abnormal and threatening behavior.

### Threat Intelligence Database Correlation

- UTMStack analyzes all available security IP feeds, mainly related to online attacks, online service abuse, malware, botnets, command and control servers, and other cybercrime activities.

## Creating Custom Detection Rules

UTMStack allows users to create custom detection rules to tailor the platform's capabilities to specific security needs. The process involves defining conditions and actions that the system should take when certain criteria are met.

### Rule Execution and Management

The API provides schemas for managing rule execution status and non-execution causes. The statuses include `EXECUTED`, `PENDING`, and `FAILED`, while non-execution causes can be `AGENT_OFFLINE`, `AGENT_NOT_FOUND`, or `UNKNOWN`.

### Alert and Response Rules

UTMStack supports the creation of alert response rules with properties such as `active`, `agentPlatform`, `command`, and `conditions`. These rules can be customized to trigger specific actions based on detected threats.

## Advanced Data Visualization and Reporting

UTMStack offers advanced data visualization and reporting tools, allowing organizations to create custom dashboards and reports to fit unique use cases. This feature is crucial for compliance management and provides interactive dashboards for advanced analysis.

## Summary

UTMStack's comprehensive threat detection capabilities are built on a robust framework of rule-based, heuristic, and machine learning technologies. By creating custom detection rules, organizations can enhance their security posture and tailor the platform to their specific needs.
