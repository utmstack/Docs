# Scaling Guidelines for UTMStack

**Version:** v10.9.0
**Group:** Performance and Optimization
**Page Type:** Guide
**Description:** Scale UTMStack for high-volume environments

## Introduction

This guide provides comprehensive instructions on scaling UTMStack to accommodate high-volume environments. UTMStack is an open-source security platform designed to handle large data volumes through optimized system requirements and architecture. This document outlines the necessary hardware specifications, storage methods, and architectural considerations to ensure optimal performance and scalability.

## Data Storage Overview

UTMStack employs two primary data storage methods:

- **Hot Log Storage:** Data that is readily accessible for immediate analysis.
- **Cold Storage:** Archived data that requires restoration before access.

### Data Source Assumptions

- 50 data sources (devices) generate approximately 100 GB of data per month.

## UTMStack Server Specifications

The server specifications for managing UTMStack operations vary based on the number of data sources and the volume of data. Below are the recommended hardware specifications for hot log storage:

| Data Sources (Approx. Monthly Data) | Cores | RAM | Disk Space |
| ------------------------------------- | ------- | ------- | ------------ |
| 50 (100 GB) | 8 | 16 GB | 150 GB |
| 120 (250 GB) | 16 | 32 GB | 250 GB |
| 240 (500 GB) | 32 | 64 GB | 450 GB |

&gt; **Scalability:** These tiers can be adjusted based on the number of devices and desired log retention period.

## Architecture Requirements

To run UTMStack optimally, your hardware must meet the following minimum specifications:

- **Processor:** Must support x86-64 v2 architecture.
- **Operating System:** Ubuntu 22.04 LTS is officially supported.

### CPU Requirements for Virtualized Environments

UTMStack supports the following CPU architectures in QEMU/KVM environments:

1. **x86-64-v2 (QEMU):** Optimized 64-bit architecture with second-gen instruction set.
2. **x86-64-v2-AES (QEMU):** Adds AES-NI encryption acceleration for improved security.
3. **x86-64-v4 (QEMU):** Advanced fourth-generation architecture with enhanced performance.
4. **Host (KVM):** Uses the host processorâ€™s features directly for maximum performance.

## Integration and Logging Volume Considerations

- Each integration requires at least 1GB of reserved space to maintain efficient system operation.
- If logs exceed 1GB within a 10-minute interval, immediate contact with the support team is required to maintain stability and performance.

## Installation Recommendations

### Operating System

UTMStack is designed to be installed on Ubuntu 22.04 LTS. The installation can be performed using an installer file or an ISO image.

### System Resources

For one month of hot log storage, the following resources are recommended:

- **50 data sources (120 GB):** 4 Cores, 16 GB RAM, 150 GB Disk Space
- **120 data sources (250 GB):** 8 Cores, 16 GB RAM, 250 GB Disk Space
- **240 data sources (500 GB):** 16 Cores, 32 GB RAM, 500 GB Disk Space
- **500 data sources (1000 GB):** 32 Cores, 64 GB RAM, 1000 GB Disk Space

&gt; **Note:** Going above 500 data sources/devices requires adding secondary nodes for horizontal scaling.

## Summary

Scaling UTMStack for high-volume environments involves understanding and implementing the appropriate server specifications, architecture requirements, and storage methods. By adhering to these guidelines, you can ensure that UTMStack operates efficiently and effectively, even as data volumes increase.
