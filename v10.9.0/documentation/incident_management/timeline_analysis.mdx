# Timeline Analysis

## Introduction

In the realm of incident management, timeline analysis plays a crucial role in reconstructing attack timelines and sequences. This guide focuses on the tools and schemas provided by UTMStack for tracking incident history and analyzing security events. UTMStack is a comprehensive cybersecurity platform that integrates essential security services, making it easier to manage and investigate security incidents.

## Incident History Tracking

UTMStack provides a structured schema for tracking the history of incidents. This schema includes several key components that are essential for reconstructing and analyzing incident timelines:

- **UtmIncidentHistory**: This object is central to tracking incident history. It includes required fields such as `action`, `actionCreatedBy`, `actionDate`, `actionType`, and `incidentId`. The `actionType` can include various events such as `INCIDENT_CREATED`, `INCIDENT_MERGED`, `INCIDENT_COMPLETED`, and more.

- **UtmIncidentHistoryCriteria**: This object defines the criteria for filtering incident history. It includes properties like `id`, `incidentId`, `actionDate`, `actionType`, `actionCreatedBy`, `action`, and `actionDetail`.

## Schema Objects for Incident Management

Several schema objects are defined to manage incidents effectively:

- **UtmIncident**: This object includes fields such as `incidentCreatedDate`, `incidentDescription`, `incidentName`, `incidentSeverity`, and `incidentStatus`. The status can be `OPEN`, `IN_REVIEW`, `COMPLETED`, or `MERGED`.

- **UtmIncidentAlert**: This object tracks alerts related to incidents. Required fields include `alertId`, `alertName`, `alertSeverity`, `alertStatus`, and `incidentId`.

- **UtmIncidentNote**: This object is used for adding notes to incidents. It includes fields like `incidentId`, `noteText`, `noteSendDate`, and `noteSendBy`.

## Action and Alert Criteria

UTMStack defines criteria for actions and alerts associated with incidents:

- **UtmIncidentActionCriteria**: This object includes properties like `id`, `actionCommand`, `actionDescription`, `actionParams`, `actionType`, and `actionEditable`.

- **UtmIncidentAlertCriteria**: This object includes properties such as `id`, `incidentId`, `alertId`, `alertName`, `alertStatus`, and `alertSeverity`.

## Advanced Features of UTMStack

UTMStack offers a range of advanced features that enhance its incident management capabilities:

- **Log Management (SIEM)**: Real-time log collection and correlation, along with a dashboard and report builder for forensic analysis.

- **Threat Detection Technology**: Utilizes rule-based and heuristic analysis engines, as well as machine learning algorithms for anomaly detection.

- **Compliance Management**: Provides compliance reports and dashboards for standards like HIPAA, GLBA, SOC 2, and more.

- **Incident Response**: Automated and on-demand incident response capabilities, including host lockdown and IP blocking.

## Summary

UTMStack provides a robust framework for timeline analysis in incident management. By utilizing structured schemas and advanced features, security professionals can effectively reconstruct and analyze attack timelines. The integration of various security services within UTMStack simplifies the process of managing and investigating security incidents.
