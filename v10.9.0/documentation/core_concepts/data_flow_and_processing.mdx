# Data Flow and Processing in UTMStack

## Introduction

This document provides an overview of how log data flows through the UTMStack platform, focusing on data storage, processing, and retention mechanisms. UTMStack is a comprehensive cybersecurity platform designed for hybrid environments, offering integrated services such as SIEM, threat detection, compliance management, and more. Understanding the data flow is crucial for optimizing performance and ensuring compliance with security regulations.

## Data Storage Overview

UTMStack employs two primary methods for data retention:

- **Hot Log Storage**: This refers to data that is not archived and can be accessed at any time for immediate analysis. It is designed for real-time access and is crucial for active monitoring and threat detection.
- **Cold Storage**: This involves archived data that must be restored before it can be accessed. It is used for long-term storage and compliance purposes.

Data sources in UTMStack can include devices, agents, or SaaS integrations, each contributing to the overall data volume processed by the platform.

## UTMStack Server Specifications

The server specifications for UTMStack are determined by the number of data sources and the volume of data generated. Below are the recommended hardware specifications for hot log storage:

| Data Sources (Approx. Monthly Data) | Cores | RAM | Disk Space |
| ------------------------------------- | ------- | ------- | ------------ |
| 50 (100 GB) | 8 | 16 GB | 150 GB |
| 120 (250 GB) | 16 | 32 GB | 250 GB |
| 240 (500 GB) | 32 | 64 GB | 450 GB |

Scalability is a key feature, allowing these tiers to be adjusted based on the number of devices and desired log retention period.

## Architecture Requirements

To ensure optimal performance, UTMStack requires specific architecture features:

- **Processor Requirements**: Must support x86-64 v2 architecture.
- **Virtualized Environments**: Ensure compatibility with the specified CPU requirements.

## Data Retention

UTMStack manages data retention through several mechanisms to optimize storage and maintain system performance:

- **Index Rollover**: Automatically deletes indices based on conditions like data size or age, helping to manage storage efficiently.
- **Snapshot Archiving**: Allows for the archiving of data snapshots, which can be restored as needed.
- **Hot and Cold Storage Configurations**: Ensures that actively accessed data is stored in hot storage, while less frequently accessed data is archived in cold storage.

### Configuring Data Retention

1. Navigate to `Application Management` &gt; `Data Retention`.
2. Set the desired retention period in days.
3. Click ‘Save’ to confirm your changes.

## Summary

UTMStack's data flow and processing capabilities are designed to handle large volumes of log data efficiently, with flexible storage options and robust data retention policies. By understanding these core concepts, users can optimize their UTMStack deployment to meet their specific security and compliance needs.
