# Real-time Correlation Engine

## Overview

The Real-time Correlation Engine in UTMStack is a core component of its cybersecurity platform, designed to analyze data before ingestion to maximize real-time threat detection and response. This document provides an overview of the engine's capabilities, its integration within UTMStack, and the differences between its Open Source and Enterprise versions.

## Key Features

### Pre-ingestion Correlation

UTMStack's correlation engine processes data before it is ingested into the system. This approach reduces the workload on the system and improves response times by identifying threats at their source in real-time.

### Threat Detection and Intelligence

UTMStack integrates rule-based, heuristic, and machine learning threat detection technologies. The platform leverages a combination of:

- **Rule-based Network and Host Intrusion Detection**: Analyzes network traffic, protocols, and DNS for suspicious activities.
- **Heuristic and Rule-based Analysis Engine**: Utilizes over 154,000 detection rules to aggregate, correlate, and analyze log data and system activities.
- **Machine Learning Anomaly-based Engine**: Learns from the environment to identify abnormal and threatening behavior.
- **Threat Intelligence Database Correlation**: Processes security IP feeds related to online attacks, malware, botnets, and more.

### Advanced Data Visualization and Reporting

UTMStack provides customizable dashboards and reports, allowing users to create, modify, and delete them without coding. This flexibility supports forensic analysis, compliance auditing, and real-time monitoring.

## Enterprise vs. Open Source Versions

The Enterprise version of UTMStack's correlation engine includes additional features such as:

- Dedicated support
- Faster correlation capabilities
- Frequent threat intelligence updates
- Integration of Artificial Intelligence

These features are tailored to benefit enterprises and Managed Service Providers (MSPs).

## Security and Compliance

UTMStack ensures robust security measures, including:

- Daily code reviews for vulnerabilities
- Yearly penetration testing
- TLS encryption for data in transit
- Strong authentication protocols

The platform supports compliance with regulations such as HIPAA, GLBA, SOC 2, GPDR, and PCI-DSS, offering built-in reports and customizable compliance dashboards.
