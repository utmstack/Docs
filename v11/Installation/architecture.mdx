## Deployment Models

UTMStack v11 supports multiple deployment models to meet different organizational needs:

### 1. Single Node Deployment (Standalone)

  noZoom
  className="block rounded-xl"
  src="/images/architecture/architecture_diagram1.png"
  alt="Single Node Deployment"
/>

**Best for**: Small to medium organizations with up to 500 data sources

A **single node deployment** combines both manager and worker functions on one server, providing:
- Complete data control and isolation
- Simplified management
- Lower infrastructure costs
- Suitable for on-premises or cloud deployment
- Full SIEM/XDR capabilities

**Characteristics**:
- All-in-one installation
- Direct log collection from devices
- Local data storage
- No external dependencies
- Enhanced security through data isolation

---

### 2. Multi-Node Deployment (Manager + Workers)

<img
  height="200"
  noZoom
  className="block rounded-xl"
  src="/images/architecture/architecture_diagram2.png"
  alt="Multi-Node Deployment"
/>

**Best for**: Large organizations with 500+ data sources requiring high performance

A **multi-node deployment** separates management from processing:
- One manager node for coordination
- Multiple worker nodes for data processing
- Horizontal scalability
- High availability options
- Load distribution

**Characteristics**:
- Scalable architecture
- Add workers as needed
- Parallel log processing
- Better resource utilization
- Handles large data volumes efficiently

---

### 3. Federated Deployment (MSP Model)

<img
  height="200"
  noZoom
  className="block rounded-xl"
  src="/images/architecture/architecture_diagram2.png"
  alt="Federated Master Deployment"
/>

**Best for**: Managed Service Providers (MSPs) managing multiple customers

The **federated deployment model** enables centralized management across multiple UTMStack instances:
- Separate UTMStack installation per customer
- Central federation server for unified monitoring
- Multi-tenant architecture
- Centralized alerting and reporting
- Customer data isolation

**Characteristics**:
- One instance per customer network
- Central monitoring dashboard
- Unified alert management
- Efficient multi-customer oversight
- Scalable MSP operations

<Tip>
This model is commonly used by SOC teams for its simplicity and effectiveness in managing multiple client environments.
</Tip>

### 4. SaaS Deployment (Fully Managed)

<img
  height="200"
  noZoom
  className="block rounded-xl"
  src="/images/architecture/architecture_diagram3.png"
  alt="SaaS Deployment"
/>

**Best for**: Organizations preferring a fully managed solution

The **SaaS deployment model** provides a turnkey, cloud-hosted solution:
- Hosted and managed by UTMStack
- Automatic updates and scaling
- High availability included
- Professional support
- No infrastructure management

**Characteristics**:
- Cloud-based deployment
- Agents or SyslogTLS for log collection
- Automatic backups
- 24/7 monitoring
- Managed updates and maintenance
- Focus on your business, not infrastructure

## Data Flow Architecture

```mermaid
graph TB
    A[Data Sources] --> B[Collection Layer]
    B --> C[EventProcessor]
    C --> D[Correlation Engine]
    D --> E[Storage Layer]
    D --> F[Alert Engine]
    F --> G[SOAR Workflows]
    E --> H[Query Engine]
    H --> I[Web Interface]
    F --> I
    G --> I
```

### Processing Pipeline

1. **Data Collection**: Agents, syslog, APIs collect logs from sources
2. **EventProcessor**: Parses and normalizes incoming data
3. **Correlation Engine**: Real-time correlation before storage
4. **Storage Layer**: Elasticsearch for indexed log storage
5. **Alert Engine**: Generates alerts based on correlation rules
6. **SOAR**: Automated response workflows
7. **Query Engine**: Fast search and analysis
8. **Web Interface**: User interaction and visualization

## Scalability Considerations

### When to Scale Horizontally

<Steps>
  <Step title="Monitor Performance Metrics">
    Watch CPU, memory, and disk I/O on your manager node
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Add Worker Nodes When">
    - Processing more than 500 data sources
    - CPU usage consistently above 70%
    - Log ingestion delays occur
    - Real-time correlation lags
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Scale Gradually">
    Add worker nodes one at a time and monitor improvement
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Optimize Distribution">
    Configure plugin distribution across workers for optimal performance
  </Step>
</Steps>

---

## High Availability Options

For mission-critical deployments:

- **Database Clustering**: Elasticsearch cluster for data redundancy
- **Manager Redundancy**: Active-passive manager configuration
- **Worker Pools**: Multiple workers ensure continued processing
- **Load Balancing**: Distribute user connections across manager nodes
- **Backup Systems**: Automated backup and disaster recovery

---

## Network Architecture

### Required Connectivity

```
Manager Node:
  ← Data Sources (various ports)
  ← Worker Nodes (internal)
  ← Administrators (443/TCP)
  → Central Server (optional)

Worker Nodes:
  ← Data Sources (various ports)
  → Manager Node (internal)
  → Elasticsearch (internal)
```

### Security Zones

- **DMZ**: Agent collectors and log receivers
- **Internal**: Core processing and storage
- **Management**: Web interface and administration
- **Isolated**: Customer data in federated deployments
