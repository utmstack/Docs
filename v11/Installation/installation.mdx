---

This guide provides comprehensive instructions for installing UTMStack v11 on Ubuntu 24.04 LTS using the installer script.

<Note>
**Alternative Installation Method**: You can also install UTMStack using an automated ISO image. See the [Installation from ISO](/v11/Installation/installation-from-iso) guide for details.
</Note>

---

## Prerequisites

### Operating System

<Info>
This installation guide is designed for **Ubuntu 24.04 LTS**. UTMStack v11 also supports Red Hat systems.
</Info>

---

## System Requirements

The following recommendations are based on the number of data sources and desired hot log storage retention.

### Definitions

- **Hot log storage**: Non-archived data that can be accessed for analysis at any time
- **Cold log storage**: Archived data that must be restored before accessing
- **Data source**: Any individual source of logs (devices, agents, SaaS integrations)

### Sizing Guidelines

**Assumption**: 60 data sources generate approximately 100 GB of monthly data.

<Tip>
Resources needed for **one month of hot log storage**:

## Installation Steps

### Step 1: Preparing for Installation

Update the system and install required dependencies:

```bash
# Update packages list
sudo apt update

# Install WGET
sudo apt install wget

# Download the latest installer
wget http://github.com/utmstack/UTMStack/releases/latest/download/installer

# Switch to root user
sudo su

# Set execution permissions
chmod +x installer
```

<Note>
Make sure you have a stable internet connection during the installation process.
</Note>

---

### Step 2: Running the Installation

Execute the installer without parameters:

```bash
./installer
```

The installer will:
1. Check system requirements
2. Download necessary components
3. Configure the system
4. Set up containers and services
5. Generate initial credentials

<Info>
The installation process may take 15-30 minutes depending on your internet connection and system resources.
</Info>

---

### Step 3: Post-Installation Configuration

Once UTMStack is installed, you can access the platform:

#### Default Credentials

- **Username**: `admin`
- **Password**: Generated during installation

<Warning>
The password and other generated configurations can be found in `/root/utmstack.yml`

**Important**: Store these credentials securely and change the default password immediately after first login.
</Warning>

#### Accessing the Platform

Use HTTPS to access the login page:

```
https://your-server-ip
```

or

```
https://your-domain.com
```

<Note>
UTMStack requires HTTPS for secure access. HTTP requests will be automatically redirected to HTTPS.
</Note>

## Post-Installation Steps

<Steps>
  <Step title="Secure Your Credentials">
    1. Back up the `/root/utmstack.yml` file to a secure location
    2. Change the default admin password
    3. Enable and configure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) - **mandatory in v11**
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Configure Firewall Rules">
    Set up firewall rules according to the port requirements and security recommendations above
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Configure SSL Certificate">
    For production environments, configure a valid SSL certificate:
    - Use Let's Encrypt with Certbot (recommended)
    - Or import your own SSL certificate
    
    See the SSL Certificate configuration guide for detailed instructions
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Connect Data Sources">
    Begin connecting your data sources and integrations:
    - Install agents on endpoints
    - Configure log forwarding from network devices
    - Set up SaaS integrations
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Configure Central Management (Optional)">
    If you're managing multiple UTMStack instances, configure central server connectivity for:
    - Centralized updates
    - Remote log submission
    - Unified management
  </Step>
</Steps>

---

## Verification

After installation, verify that UTMStack is running correctly:

```bash
# Check container status
docker ps

# Check system logs
docker logs utmstack_backend

# Verify web interface accessibility
curl -k https://localhost
```

All containers should be in a "healthy" or "running" state.

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Installation fails due to insufficient resources" icon="memory">
    Ensure your system meets the minimum requirements for your deployment size. Check available RAM, CPU, and disk space:
    
    ```bash
    free -h
    lscpu
    df -h
    ```
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Cannot access web interface" icon="browser">
    1. Verify firewall rules allow ports 80 and 443
    2. Check that containers are running: `docker ps`
    3. Verify HTTPS is being used in the URL
    4. Check system logs: `docker logs utmstack_backend`
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Forgot admin password" icon="key">
    The generated password is stored in `/root/utmstack.yml`. Access this file as root to recover the credentials.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Installation interrupted or failed" icon="circle-exclamation">
    1. Remove existing installation: `./installer --remove`
    2. Clean up Docker resources: `docker system prune -a`
    3. Restart the installation process
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Additional Installation Options

### Red Hat Installation

UTMStack v11 now supports Red Hat-based systems. The installation process is similar, but uses `dnf` instead of `apt`:

```bash
# Update packages
sudo dnf update

# Install WGET
sudo dnf install wget

# Continue with standard installation steps
```
