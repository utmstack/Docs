# Installation Guide for UTMStack v11

This guide provides comprehensive instructions for installing UTMStack v11 on Ubuntu 22.04 LTS. The installation can be performed using an installer file or an ISO image.

<Note>
**ISO Installation Available**: You can also install UTMStack using an [ISO image](https://cdn.utmstack.com/iso/utmstack-v11-autoinstall.iso). The instructions below are for the installer file method.

Default Ubuntu Server credentials (for ISO installation): 
- User: `utmstack`
- Password: `utmstack`
</Note>

---

## Prerequisites

### Operating System

<Info>
This installation guide is designed for **Ubuntu 22.04 LTS**. UTMStack v11 also supports Red Hat systems.
</Info>

---

## System Requirements

The following recommendations are based on the number of data sources and desired hot log storage retention.

### Definitions

- **Hot log storage**: Non-archived data that can be accessed for analysis at any time
- **Cold log storage**: Archived data that must be restored before accessing
- **Data source**: Any individual source of logs (devices, agents, SaaS integrations)

### Sizing Guidelines

**Assumption**: 60 data sources generate approximately 100 GB of monthly data.

<Tip>
Resources needed for **one month of hot log storage**:
</Tip>

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Small Deployment" icon="server">
    **50 data sources** (120 GB hot storage)
    - 4 CPU Cores
    - 16 GB RAM
    - 150 GB Disk Space
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Medium Deployment" icon="server">
    **120 data sources** (250 GB hot storage)
    - 8 CPU Cores
    - 16 GB RAM
    - 250 GB Disk Space
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Large Deployment" icon="server">
    **240 data sources** (500 GB hot storage)
    - 16 CPU Cores
    - 32 GB RAM
    - 500 GB Disk Space
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Enterprise Deployment" icon="server">
    **500 data sources** (1000 GB hot storage)
    - 32 CPU Cores
    - 64 GB RAM
    - 1000 GB Disk Space
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Note>
You may combine these tiers to allocate resources based on the number of devices and desired hot log storage retention.
</Note>

<Warning>
**Horizontal Scaling Required**: Going above 500 data sources/devices requires adding secondary nodes (workers) for horizontal scaling. UTMStack v11's new architecture supports this seamlessly.
</Warning>

## Installation Steps

### Step 1: Preparing for Installation

Update the system and install required dependencies:

```bash
# Update packages list
sudo apt update

# Install WGET
sudo apt install wget

# Download the latest installer
wget http://github.com/utmstack/UTMStack/releases/latest/download/installer

# Switch to root user
sudo su

# Set execution permissions
chmod +x installer
```

<Note>
Make sure you have a stable internet connection during the installation process.
</Note>

---

### Step 2: Running the Installation

Execute the installer without parameters:

```bash
./installer
```

The installer will:
1. Check system requirements
2. Download necessary components
3. Configure the system
4. Set up containers and services
5. Generate initial credentials

<Info>
The installation process may take 15-30 minutes depending on your internet connection and system resources.
</Info>

---

### Step 3: Post-Installation Configuration

Once UTMStack is installed, you can access the platform:

#### Default Credentials

- **Username**: `admin`
- **Password**: Generated during installation

<Warning>
The password and other generated configurations can be found in `/root/utmstack.yml`

**Important**: Store these credentials securely and change the default password immediately after first login.
</Warning>

#### Accessing the Platform

Use HTTPS to access the login page:

```
https://your-server-ip
```

or

```
https://your-domain.com
```

<Note>
UTMStack requires HTTPS for secure access. HTTP requests will be automatically redirected to HTTPS.
</Note>

## Post-Installation Steps

<Steps>
  <Step title="Secure Your Credentials">
    1. Back up the `/root/utmstack.yml` file to a secure location
    2. Change the default admin password
    3. Enable and configure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) - **mandatory in v11**
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Configure Firewall Rules">
    Set up firewall rules according to the port requirements and security recommendations above
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Configure SSL Certificate">
    For production environments, configure a valid SSL certificate:
    - Use Let's Encrypt with Certbot (recommended)
    - Or import your own SSL certificate
    
    See the SSL Certificate configuration guide for detailed instructions
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Connect Data Sources">
    Begin connecting your data sources and integrations:
    - Install agents on endpoints
    - Configure log forwarding from network devices
    - Set up SaaS integrations
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Configure Central Management (Optional)">
    If you're managing multiple UTMStack instances, configure central server connectivity for:
    - Centralized updates
    - Remote log submission
    - Unified management
  </Step>
</Steps>

---

## Verification

After installation, verify that UTMStack is running correctly:

```bash
# Check container status
docker ps

# Check system logs
docker logs utmstack_backend

# Verify web interface accessibility
curl -k https://localhost
```

All containers should be in a "healthy" or "running" state.

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Installation fails due to insufficient resources" icon="memory">
    Ensure your system meets the minimum requirements for your deployment size. Check available RAM, CPU, and disk space:
    
    ```bash
    free -h
    lscpu
    df -h
    ```
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Cannot access web interface" icon="browser">
    1. Verify firewall rules allow ports 80 and 443
    2. Check that containers are running: `docker ps`
    3. Verify HTTPS is being used in the URL
    4. Check system logs: `docker logs utmstack_backend`
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Forgot admin password" icon="key">
    The generated password is stored in `/root/utmstack.yml`. Access this file as root to recover the credentials.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Installation interrupted or failed" icon="circle-exclamation">
    1. Remove existing installation: `./installer --remove`
    2. Clean up Docker resources: `docker system prune -a`
    3. Restart the installation process
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Additional Installation Options

### ISO Installation

For organizations requiring offline or fully guided installations:

1. Download the ISO image from [utmstack.com/install](https://cdn.utmstack.com/iso/utmstack-v11-autoinstall.iso)
2. Create a bootable USB or mount the ISO in your virtualization platform
3. Follow the graphical installation wizard
4. Default credentials: `utmstack / utmstack`

### Red Hat Installation

UTMStack v11 now supports Red Hat-based systems. The installation process is similar, but uses `dnf` instead of `apt`:

```bash
# Update packages
sudo dnf update

# Install WGET
sudo dnf install wget

# Continue with standard installation steps
```

---

## Scaling Your Deployment

UTMStack v11 introduces horizontal scaling capabilities with worker nodes.

### Adding Worker Nodes

To scale beyond 500 data sources or improve processing capacity:

1. Install UTMStack on additional servers using the same installer
2. Configure them as worker nodes during installation
3. Connect workers to the manager node
4. Distribute processing load automatically

<Info>
Worker nodes can run plugins and process data in parallel with the manager, eliminating bottlenecks and providing linear scalability.
